Entry management 

Brief Description
This use case describes how a user manages entries within a project.
An Entry represents a node in the Project’s hierarchical tree and may contain text, comments, and relationships to parent and child entries.
Flow of Events
Basic Flow 
The use case begins when the user chooses to interact with a project’s entry.
Start
The system displays the project’s entry tree.
The user can select an existing entry or create a new one.
Import: The user can import a project from JSON or supported text formats. The system parses the file and reconstructs the sub-entry tree. 
the system displays the entry’s content and metadata.
Navigating the entry tree.
The user can see the entry’s parent and subtree.
Permissions allowing, the user can travel up or down the entry tree.
At each step, the system displays the entry’s content and metadata. 
Edit the selected Entry’s content.
The user can modify the entry’s title and content.
The system saves the changes.
Add Comments to the entry: 
The user can add comments to the entry.
The system records the new comment in the entry’s “commentaires” list. 
Change entry relationships:
The user can redefine parentEntry and childEntries relationships.
The system updates the entry tree structure accordingly.
Exporting the entry’s subtree:
The user can request an export of entry structures to JSON, TXT, or XML.
The system generates and provides the requested export.
Alternative Flows
Invalid Data or Save Error
If the user provides incomplete or invalid data (e.g., missing title), the system displays an error message.
Export Failure 
If the export cannot be generated (e.g., corrupted entry relationships), the system notifies the user and logs the error.
Invalid Relationship
If a circular dependency is detected in the entry tree, the system prevents the change and alerts the user.
Special Requirements
The system must support exporting diagrams in standard formats (e.g., PNG, SVG, UML XMI).
The system should maintain a modification history for each entry.
Entry edits and comments must be timestamped and associated with the user.
Pre-Conditions
The user is authenticated and has access rights to the project and the entry.
Post-Conditions
The system’s entry tree, modification history, and associated data are updated.
If unsuccessful, no changes are made to the project’s entries.
Extension Points
Comment Management: Can extend to allow threaded discussions or comment tagging.
Version Control: Can extend to support rollback to previous entry states.
Collaboration: Can extend to allow simultaneous editing by multiple users.
