# Opal - Software Engineering Project

Opal is a Java-based application designed for note taking and organization. It allows users to create, edit, and manage notes in a structured manner. The application is built using JavaFX and follows a clean architecture pattern, separating concerns into distinct layers.

## Key Use Cases

Based on the design, the application primarily handles:

### 1. Authentication
- **Login**: Users can authenticate using their credentials.
- **Register**: New users can create an account.
- **Logout**: Secure termination of the user session.
- **Profile Management**: Users can view and update their profiles and permissions.

### 2. Friends & Inter-relations
- **Manage Friends**: Users can add, remove, or list friends.
- **Search**: Functionality to search for other users.

### 3. Session Management
- **Session Tracking**: Active sessions are tracked with unique IDs.
- **Properties**: Management of session-specific properties, like the primary color and the font size.
